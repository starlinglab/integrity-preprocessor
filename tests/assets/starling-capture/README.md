# starling-capture test assets

The folder `official-examples` comes from a ZIP called [starling-capture-verification-examples.zip](https://github.com/numbersprotocol/starling-capture/files/9348273/starling-capture-verification-examples.zip) linked on the Starling Capture [wiki](https://github.com/numbersprotocol/starling-capture/wiki/Development#verification). That folder does not contain any failing examples. Those are in the `bad` folder, which mirrors the structure of `official-examples`.
